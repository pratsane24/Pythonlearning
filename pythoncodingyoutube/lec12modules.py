# Modules is a way to reuse a code written by someone else.
# you can use module written by someone else for free in your code.
# Let's start with 1st module maths.

# import math
# print(math.sqrt(16))
# print(math.pow(2,5))

# How to know which functions are present under math module?
# We can use the following method
# For find dir of math we need to import math or error will occur as math is not defined.

# print(dir(math))

#And another methos is to Google it "python 3 math module".

# print(math.pi)
# print(math.log10(100))
# print(math.log10(1000))
# print(math.floor(2.3))
# print(math.ceil(2.3))



# Let's do another module Calendar.
# import calendar
# cal=calendar.month(2016,1)
# print(cal)
# print(calendar.isleap(2016))
# print(calendar.isleap(2015))
# print(dir(calendar))

# How to find all modules present in python just Google it "python 3.5 modules list".


# Question :- There is a custom need & and I want to write my own module?
# You can import it from that location.
# To find a module, python will use current directory and then all directories listed in system path.
