# What is data type?
# Data types are used before the variable to know which type of values are stored in variables
# Data types are actually classes and variables are instance(object) of these classes. 
# In python we don't have to define data type it assumes on it own from the value entered.


#BUILT -IN DATA TYPE 
# following are the python's built in data type
# 1.Numeric
# 2.Sequence type
# 3.Boolean
# 4.set
# 5.Dictionary

# E.g Numeric data type
# Int Datatype
# a=10
# print(type(a))

# # Float Datatype
# b=10.5
# print(type(b))

# # Complex Number
# c=2+4j
# print(type(c))

#  Boolean Datatype
# d=True
# print(type(d))

# e=False
# print(type(e))

# True and false are the only values in Boolean datatype.

# Set Datatype
# Sets are defined from {} brackets
# f={'a','b','c'}
# print(type(f))

# Dictonary Data type
# It is also indentified from {} bracket.
# x={"key":"Value"}
# print(type(x))

# Sequence datatype
# List datatype
# l1=[1,2,3,4,5]
# print(type(l1))

# String Data type
# y="python program"
# print(type(y))

# Tuple Data type
# Tuple is identified from () brackets
# z=(1,2,3,4,5)
# print(type(z))
